# Loan_eligibility_prediction
Project Objective
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA and ML is the aim of this case study.

When a company receives a loan application, it has to make a decision about loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the company’s decision: Giving loans out to potential defaulters and rejecting customers who will actually pay back.
